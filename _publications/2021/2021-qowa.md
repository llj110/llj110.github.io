  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to detect the sentiment polarities of a sentence with a given aspect. Aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA) is a subtask of ABSA, in ATSA, the aspect is given by aspect term: a word or a phrase in sentence. In previous work, most models apply attention mechanism or gating mechanism to capture the key part of the sentence and detect the sentiment polarity by classifying the weighted sum vector, which are regardless of the aspect information during the classification. However, same contexts may show different sentiment polarity with differnet aspects. For example, in sentence “The scene hunky waiters dub diner darling and it sounds like they mean it.” the context “dub diner dearling” shows negative polarity towards the aspect term “waiters”. But in sentence “The diner's husband dub diner darling.”, the same context would show neural polarity towards “husband”. The absent of aspect information would make model get a wrong result in some sentence. To solve this problem, we propose a model called Trasfomer-based context-aspect Relation Detect Model (TRDM), and add two special tokens “[CLSA]” and “[SEPA]” to specify the aspect term in the sentence. TRDM uses the embedding of two tyes of tokens (i.e. “[CLS]” and “[CLSA]”) for classification where “[CLS]” is used to represent the entire sentence in BERT. This scheme enable TRDM to combine the sentence information and aspect information in the step of sentiment polarity classification. We evaluate the performance of our model on two datasets: Restaurant dataset from SemEval2014 and MAMS from NLPCC 2020. Experiment results show that our model obtain noticeable improvement compared with state-of-art transfromer-based models.
