  This data set is a data set used for aircraft theoretical velocity ranking. Four sensors are randomly arranged in a 1*1 square map, and three aircraft will fly over the map coverage area at the same time. The velocity of the aircraft is simulated by a random process. The theoretical velocities of the three aircraft are similar, and the velocity of the aircraft will be disturbed during actual flight, causing large fluctuations, so that it is difficult to distinguish the theoretical velocity order of the aircraft flying into the map. The coverage area of the sensor is circular with a fixed radius. The four sensors have a unified detection interval event and will detect the position of the aircraft within the coverage area with unified accuracy. The target task is to reason the theoretical velocity ranking of three aircraft through the trajectory data collected by the sensors.
