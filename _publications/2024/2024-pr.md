  Time series has attracted a lot of attention in many fields today. Time series forecasting algorithm based on complex network analysis is a research hotspot. How to use time series information to achieve more accurate forecasting is a problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a weighted network forecasting method to improve the forecasting accuracy. Firstly, the time series will be transformed into a complex network, and the similarity between nodes will be found. Then, the similarity will be used as a weight to make weighted forecasting on the predicted values produced by different nodes. Compared with the previous method, the proposed method is more accurate. In order to verify the effect of the proposed method, the experimental part is tested on M1, M3 datasets and Construction Cost Index (CCI) dataset, which shows that the proposed method has more accurate forecasting performance.
