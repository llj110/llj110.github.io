  Greetings, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, with an anticipated graduation date of June 2026. My research focuses on the fields of time series analysis, statistical physics, information theory, and evidence theory. I am deeply passionate about exploring the intersections within these disciplines and addressing the complex challenges they present.

  I am actively seeking a fully-funded Ph.D. position in Computer Science, where I hope to join a vibrant research community and collaborate with like-minded scholars in pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. If my research interests align with yours, or if you see potential for a research collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via email or WeChat (please indicate the purpose of your contact when messaging).

  I look forward to connecting with you and am excited about the prospect of collectively advancing the field of science.
